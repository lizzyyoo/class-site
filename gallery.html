    <h1 class="name">Do Ho Suh</h1>
    <p class="description">"I try to understand my life as a movement through different spaces"</p>
    <p class="description">"Rubbing/Loving" is Do Ho Suh's final artwork in the New York Apartment that was his home and studio for eighteen years. Every surface was wrapped with white paper and then rubbed with colored pencil to reveal and preserve all of the space's memory-provoking details.</p>

    <h1 class="name">Yayoi Kusama</h1>
    <p class="description">"Our earth is only one polka dot among a million stars in the cosmos"</p>
    <p class="description">Yayoi Kusama's compulsive use of dots was a form of therapy from unsettling hallucinations described as reocurring dots in floral patterns and bright lights that consumed the room to the extent of feeling obliterated.</p>

    <h1 class="name">Anish Kapoor</h1>
    <p class="descriptionv2">"I think I understand something about space. I think the job of a sculptor is spacial as much as it is to do with form."</p>
    <p class="descriptionv2">Anish Kapoor confronts optical perception and invites viewers to interrogate their relation to inhabited space. Through his manipulation of space and the mirrored surface, he challenges the viewer to question absence and presence.</p>
